# Azure Functions wrapper (skeleton)

This folder sketches how you could expose the same behaviors as Azure Functions
(HTTP triggers) in **Flex Consumption**. You would create handlers that call the
Spring services via a static application context holder.

For the POC, this is **optional** and not compiled by default.
